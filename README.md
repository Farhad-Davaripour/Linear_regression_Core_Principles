## Building Linear Regression from the Ground Up

This repository is home to a detailed notebook that guides you through building a linear regression model from the ground up.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (used only for creating synthetic datasets)
- IPython

### Key Components
- **Model Hypothesis**: Defines the linear regression equation \( y = xw + b \).
- **Computation Class**: Executes both forward and backward operations based on the model hypothesis.
- **Error Quantification**: Utilizes mean squared error to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Employs gradient descent to refine model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation Visuals**: Provides graphical insights into the model's efficacy and parameter evolution.

### Getting Started
1. Download the repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Execute the `demo.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
4. The notebook will guide you through constructing and assessing the linear regression model step by step.

### Graphical Insights
Included within the notebook are utilities for plotting the computational workflow, showcasing the model's fitting to the data, and illustrating the optimization process of model parameters for improved accuracy.
